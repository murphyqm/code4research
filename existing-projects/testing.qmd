# Testing

## Using the Pytest package

We're going to use Pytest in two different ways: as a command line interface application (a CLI app) and as a Python module (in Python scripts).
We'll look at it as a module first while building our tests.

### As a module

One issue we raised above is that often the values we need to check against each other are floats and are not *exactly* equal.

Lets look at the [pytest.approx](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-approx) documentation.

```python
approx(expected, rel=None, abs=None, nan_ok=False)
```
