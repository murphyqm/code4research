This course uses Python code as an example; however, the concepts discussed are language agnostic. Where possible, I have added code examples, links to resources, or equivalent package names for other languages; I will supplement this over time."

We apply the acronym DeReLiCT to help you prevent your code from falling apart, and introduce Dependency Management, Repositories and version control, Licenses and Citations, and Testing.\nWe talk through techniques you can apply if youâ€™ve only got half an hour to spare and desperately need to improve your messy codebase, and how to strategically apply techniques if you have a little bit longer.\nWe will work through some example messy code and see how to apply some of these techniques to improve its quality as a piece of research software."
